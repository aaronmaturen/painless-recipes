## Dough

- 2 eggs
- 2 cups flour
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

1. Mound flour on kneading board and make hole in center.
2. Drop eggs into hole and cut into flour with a knife.
3. Add salt and water and knead until firm.
4. Let rest for 10 minutes, covered in a large bowl.
5. Divide dough in halves and roll thin. 
6. Cut circles with a large biscuit cutter.
7. Place a small spoonful of filling in the middle of each round of dough.
8. Moisten edge with water, fold over and press edges together firmly.
9. Be sure they are well sealed to prevent the filling from running out. 
10. Drop pierogi into salted boiling water.
11. Cook gently for 3 to 5 minutes.
12. Lift out of water carefully with perforated spoon.
13. Fry in pan with butter and onions (optional).

Note: the dough has a tendency to dry while you are working. A dry dough will not 
seal completely. We suggest rolling out a large circle of dough, placing small 
mounds of filling far enough apart to allow for cutting, and folding the dough over 
the mounds of filling. Then cut with small biscuit cutter and seal firmly.

Never crowd or pile pierogi. The uncooked will stick and the cooked will lose shape and lightness.

### Filling

- 2 cups mashed potatoes
- 1 cup shredded cheese

1. Mix ingredients well.
2. Fill pierogi. 
3. Serve with sour cream.
