## Roast
- 3-4 lb beef chuck roast
- 2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 3 tablespoon olive oil 
- 1 package of pearl onions
- 6-8 large carrots peeled and cut into 2 inch pieces
- 4 fresh garlic cloves minced
- 2 tablespoon tomato paste
- 4 cups beef broth
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (could use soy sauce instead)
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 3 sprigs rosemary (about 3 inches each)
- 3 springs thyme (about 3 inches each)
- 2 bay leaves

1. Preheat the oven to 325°.
2. Place your Dutch Oven or heavy bottom pot on the stove top over medium heat, add 2 tablespoon olive oil to warm.
3. Meanwhile pat your chuck roast dry with a couple paper towels then sprinkle on the 2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper, coating both sides.
4. Place the seasoned chuck roast in the pot and brown on the first side for 5 minutes, then flip and brown the other side for 5 minutes.
5. Expert Tip: Do not disturb the roast while it is browning, it needs to stay in contact with the pan to properly brown.
6. Remove the browned roast and place it on a plate, set aside.
7. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot. Add the onions, carrots and celery to the pot and sauté for about 5 minutes.
8. Add in the garlic and tomato paste and stir around the pot for 1 minute.
9. Pour in 1 cup beef broth and deglaze the bottom of the pot.
10. Deglazing: when you scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
11. Pour in the remaining 3 cups of beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, rosemary and thyme sprigs and bay leaves.
12. Give it all a stir and then bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.
13. Once it boils remove from the heat and nestle the browned chuck roast back in the pot.
14. Expert Tip: You want the liquid to go about ½ way up the roast. Do not submerge the entire roast.
15. Place the lid on the pot and pop in the 325° preheated oven for 3.5 hours.
16. Take the pot out of the oven, remove the pot roast and cooked carrots from the pot and place on a serving platter.
17. Optional: Serve with mashed potatoes and gravy
